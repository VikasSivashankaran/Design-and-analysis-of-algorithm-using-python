'''he Subset Sum Problem is a classic computational problem where we aim to find a subset of a given set of positive integers such that their sum equals a specified positive integer. Letâ€™s delve into the details and explore different approaches to solve this problem.

Problem Statement
Given a set of non-negative integers S = {s1, s2, â€¦, sn} and a target sum d, we want to determine whether there exists a non-empty subset of S whose sum equals d.

Examples
For instance, consider the set S = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9. In this case, there are two valid solutions:
Subset 1: {1, 2, 6}
Subset 2: {1, 8}
However, if we take S = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2} and d = 30, there is no subset that adds up to 30.
Approaches to Solve Subset Sum

Recursive Approach:
    
We can recursively explore two possibilities for each element in the set:
Include the current element in the subset (subtract its value from the target sum).
Exclude the current element from the subset (keep the target sum unchanged).
The base cases are:
If the target sum becomes zero, we have found a valid subset.
If we exhaust all elements in the set, but the target sum is still non-zero, no valid subset exists.
The time complexity of this approach is exponential (O(2^n)).'''
